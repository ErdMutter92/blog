This website is a long time in the running, and while it's relatively young the idea has been around for a significantly long time. From my childhood to today, i've created, deployed, and destroyed blogs in an attempt to keep my curiosity peaked. Now that I am growing older I want something that is more stable while I focus on the iterative process of leveling up my skills. This, of course, is where the blog you have before you comes into play. This site is a focal point for past, present, and future ideas that I want to document to help myself and potentally other to grow. I'm technical in nature so the topics of this blog might vary but it will always come back to that aspect of my personality. The intention is to talk about my adventures both personally and professionally in software development and DevSecOps.

It's easy for me to pinpoint the moment my asperation with blogging developed, as it was from an early age. In my childhood I would sit cross lagged on the floor watching my mom maintain a family blog. She would use frontpage 2000 to make changes to the varius pages by updating the text or adding images before manually upload them to the web server via (S)FTP. This enevidablly lead to me creating my own site, and with that I was off to the races.
